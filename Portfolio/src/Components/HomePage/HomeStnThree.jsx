        <p>
          I am a creative Frontend Developer focused on building modern,
          user-friendly, and visually engaging web experiences. I have a strong
          sense of design and enjoy transforming ideas into clean and responsive
          interfaces. Apart from development, I work with video editing, content
          creation, and writing as a creative outlet. I also understand how
          platforms like YouTube and Instagram work, including their algorithms,
          which allows me to create content with better reach and engagement. I
          am continuously learning, improving my skills, and exploring new
          technologies to grow as a developer and creator.
