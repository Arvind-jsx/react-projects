                        Hey, I’m Arvind — a 17-year-old who accidentally fell in love with
                        computers and then decided to make it official by becoming a web
                        developer. My journey didn’t start with some dramatic “I built my
                        first app at age 10” story. It started with curiosity. I was always
                        that kid who wanted to know how things work — especially computers.
                        Buttons, screens, websites… they never felt like magic to me. They
                        felt like puzzles waiting to be solved. And honestly, I love
                        puzzles. When I first stepped into the world of web development, it
                        wasn’t because someone told me it was easy or trending. In fact, I
                        chose it for the opposite reason. I knew it would challenge me. I
                        knew there would be bugs that make no sense, code that works at 2 AM
                        but breaks at 2:01, and moments where Google becomes your best
                        friend. Still, I went all in — because interest beats ease every
                        single time. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
                        suddenly the internet stopped being just something I use — it became
                        something I could build. Watching a blank screen turn into a real,
                        working website felt insanely satisfying. Later, I moved into React,
                        where things got more complex… and way more fun. Components, states,
                        logic — messy at first, but addictive once it clicks. Right now, I’m
                        a BCA student in my first year of college, learning the academic
                        side of computers while sharpening my practical skills on my own.
                        College gives me structure, but self-learning gives me speed. I
                        enjoy experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and then breaking
                        them again — that’s how real learning happens. I don’t see web
                        development as “just coding.” For me, it’s creativity mixed with
                        logic. It’s design meeting functionality. It’s turning ideas into
                        something people can actually see, click, and use. And this website?
                        It’s not just a portfolio — it’s proof of my journey, my learning,
                        and my mindset. I’m still learning, still growing, and still
                        curious. And honestly, that’s the best part
                    </p>
