            I’m Arvind, and when it comes to CSS, trust me, I don’t just write styles—I cook visuals. I know CSS like the back of my hand, from clean layouts to pixel-perfect designs that actually feel alive on screen. Responsive design? That’s not a feature for me, it’s a habit. Mobile, tablet, laptop, ultra-wide screen—whatever device you throw at my pages, they adapt smoothly without breaking a sweat. I’ve built plenty of landing pages, the kind that don’t just sit there looking pretty but actually grab attention and keep users scrolling. Speaking of scrolling, yeah, I know smooth scrolling too—the kind that feels buttery and makes users go “damn, this feels nice.” I’m also comfortable using modern CSS techniques, including flexbox and grid, to structure layouts like a pro, keeping everything clean, aligned, and scalable. Glassmorphism? Say less. I know exactly how to create that frosted-glass effect with proper blur, transparency, and layering so it looks premium, not cheap. My designs are not just about colors and fonts; they’re about vibe, flow, and experience. I experiment, I tweak, I polish—because details matter. From hover effects that feel satisfying to animations that don’t scream for attention but still steal the show, I know how to balance style and performance. I can build almost any type of page you imagine—portfolios, skill sections, hero sections, full landing pages—without making things messy or overcomplicated. CSS for me isn’t just code, it’s creative control. I know how to make websites look modern, smooth, and straight-up cool, while keeping them fast and responsive. Long story short, if CSS was a street game, I’ve been playing it long enough to know all the moves—and yeah, I’m still leveling up every day
