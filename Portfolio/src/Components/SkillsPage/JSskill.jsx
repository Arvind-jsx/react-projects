            I’m Arvind, and JavaScript is where my websites stop being boring and start moving with purpose. I use JavaScript to bring life into the UI—clicks, scrolls, animations, logic, and interactions that actually make sense. I know how to manipulate the DOM cleanly, handle events smoothly, and make the page respond exactly how users expect (and sometimes better). Buttons don’t just sit there; they react. Sections don’t just appear; they animate in at the right moment. I’ve worked with smooth scrolling, dynamic content updates, toggles, sliders, menus, modals, and all that interactive sauce that turns a static page into an experience. I understand JavaScript fundamentals deeply—variables, functions, loops, conditions, arrays, objects—yeah, all the core stuff is locked in. I also know how to write clean, readable code instead of messy “it works somehow” scripts. I can control animations with JavaScript when CSS alone isn’t enough, and I know how to optimize performance so things stay smooth, not laggy. I’ve connected JavaScript with responsive layouts to make sure functionality stays solid on every screen size. From form validation to interactive landing pages, I’ve handled real-world use cases where logic matters more than fancy words. I’m comfortable debugging issues, fixing broken logic, and making sure everything flows correctly from start to finish. JavaScript for me is not just about writing code—it’s about problem-solving and control. I enjoy breaking down complex ideas into simple logic that actually works in production. My focus is always on user experience: fast interactions, smooth transitions, and zero confusion. I know how to combine JavaScript with CSS and HTML to build modern, interactive pages that feel premium and polished. Long story short, if a website needs brains, movement, and smart behavior, JavaScript is my weapon of choice—and yeah, I’m always leveling up, learning new tricks, and pushing my skills further every day
