            My name is Arvind, and HTML is not just a skill for me—it’s
            something I’m genuinely comfortable with. HTML (HyperText Markup
            Language) is the foundation of every website, and I know how to use
            it the right way. From structuring simple pages to building
            full-scale landing pages, I can create any kind of layout using
            clean and well-organized HTML. I have a strong understanding of
            semantic elements, proper tag hierarchy, and writing code that
            actually makes sense, not just looks good. Give me a design or even
            just an idea, and I can turn it into a solid website structure
            without stress. I’ve built multiple landing pages using pure HTML,
            and these are not just practice projects—they’re real, functional
            pages already uploaded on my GitHub profile. I focus on clarity,
            responsiveness-ready structure, and user-friendly layouts so the
            website feels smooth, not messy. I also make sure my HTML is
            readable and maintainable, because good code is about long-term
            value, not shortcuts. Overall, HTML is one of my strongest skills. I
            understand how the web works from the ground level, and I know how
            to build strong website foundations. Simple words: HTML and I are
            locked in—I know the rules, I respect the structure, and I build
            pages that stand solid.
