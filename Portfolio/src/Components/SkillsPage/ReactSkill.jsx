            I’m Arvind, and when it comes to React and JSX, that’s where I build things the smart and scalable way. I don’t just create pages—I create components that actually make sense. I understand the core idea of React: breaking the UI into reusable pieces, managing state properly, and keeping everything clean and efficient. JSX feels natural to me; mixing JavaScript logic with HTML-like structure is not confusing—it’s powerful, and I know how to use it the right way. I work comfortably with props, state, conditional rendering, and component lifecycles to control how the UI behaves at every moment. Whether it’s dynamic content, interactive sections, or real-time updates, I know how to handle it smoothly without unnecessary re-renders. I build responsive React layouts that look solid on every device, because performance and adaptability matter just as much as visuals. I’ve structured projects in a clean way so they’re easy to scale, maintain, and upgrade later without turning into a mess. From landing pages to full frontend interfaces, I know how to turn designs into functional React components that feel fast and polished. I’ve worked with hooks like useState and useEffect to manage logic, side effects, and UI updates in a clean, controlled manner. Debugging React issues doesn’t scare me—I know how to trace problems, fix bugs, and optimize components so they run smoothly. I also understand how React works with modern styling approaches, whether it’s plain CSS, component-based styling, or animation libraries. React for me is not just a framework; it’s a mindset of writing smarter code and building interfaces that scale. I focus on clean UI flow, smooth interactions, and code that other developers can actually understand. Long story short, if the project needs structure, speed, and future-ready frontend architecture, React and JSX are my go-to tools—and yeah, I’m still grinding, learning new patterns, and leveling up every single day
